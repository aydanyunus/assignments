Question:
Explain in your own words how you understand what destructuring is and why it is needed

Answer:
Destructuring is used for extracting values from arrays and objects and assigning them to variables in a more concise way and in a single statement. Destructuring improves code readability and simplifies data extraction. It allows us to extract multiple properties simultaneously, specify default values for variables in case the extracted value is undefined.
