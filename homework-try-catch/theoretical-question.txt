Question:
Provide a few examples of when it is appropriate to use the try...catch construct in code.

Answer:
The try..catch construct allows you to handle errors during code execution.
It is appropriate to use try-catch in portions of your code where you suspect errors will occur that are completely beyond your own control. Or when you want
to hide errors from the user, or any time you want to produce custom error messages.
